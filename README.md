🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict student academic performance using supervised machine learning techniques. It follows a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data exploration to deployment, and provides actionable insights into how demographic and academic factors influence student scores.

🔁 End-to-End Project Workflow

Data Collection & Understanding

Analyzed a structured student performance dataset containing demographic, social, and academic attributes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed univariate and multivariate analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Identified the impact of Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch Type, and Test Preparation on student scores.

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

Prepared a clean, model-ready dataset using Scikit-Learn pipelines.

Model Development & Training

Trained multiple supervised learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVR.

Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation & Selection

Compared models using regression metrics and selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and generalization.

Production-Ready Implementation

Refactored notebook experiments into modular, reusable Python code following best practices.

Deployment

Built a Flask web application to deploy the trained model and enable real-time student performance prediction through a user-friendly interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Flask
