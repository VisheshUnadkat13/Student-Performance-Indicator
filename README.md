🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict student academic performance using supervised machine learning techniques. It follows a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data exploration to deployment, and provides actionable insights into how demographic and academic factors influence student scores.

🔁 End-to-End Project Workflow

1)Data Collection & Understanding
Analyzed a structured student performance dataset containing demographic, social, and academic attributes.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed univariate and multivariate analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Identified the impact of Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch Type, and Test Preparation on student scores.

3)Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
Prepared a clean, model-ready dataset using Scikit-Learn pipelines.

4)Model Development & Training
Trained multiple supervised learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVR.
Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5)Model Evaluation & Selection
Compared models using regression metrics and selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and generalization.

6)Production-Ready Implementation
Refactored notebook experiments into modular, reusable Python code following best practices.

7)Deployment
Built a Flask web application to deploy the trained model and enable real-time student performance prediction through a user-friendly interface.
